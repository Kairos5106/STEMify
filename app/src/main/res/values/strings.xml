    <string name="health_lifestyle">Embracing a healthy lifestyle involves eating well, staying active, and taking care of your mental well-being.</string>

    <string name="health_1">A healthy diet
        \nA healthy diet involves eating a variety of foods in the correct proportions and consuming a calorie intake that allows for the maintenance of healthy body weight. Although this varies for everyone,
        as a general guide, this should include:
    \n\n\ta. Five portions of fruit and vegetables per day
    \n\tb. Lean proteins, especially fish, eggs, and white meat, are essential for cellular repair and provide a range of vitamins and minerals
    \n\tc. Dairy foods and their alternatives, which are a good source of protein and provide calcium.
    \n\td. Starchy foods, particularly wholegrain varieties which contain more fiber and nutrients
    \n\te. Limited amounts of unsaturated fats.
    </string>

    <string name="health_2">Physical activity
    \nThe World Health Organisation recommends that all adults undertake regular physical activity, including at least thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity daily, supplemented by at least two weight-bearing activity sessions per week.
    \n</string>

    <string name="health_3">Sleep
    \nTry to get 7-8 hours every night and try to keep a regular sleep-wake cycle – go to bed and get up at the same time every day. A good nights sleep may make you more productive and efficient on the next day.\n </string>

    <string name="health_4">Drink Plenty of Water
    \nOur body is 75% water and it is necessary to maintain the amount of liquid we consume, especially water as it is the most vital liquid humans require. 8 glasses a day also equal to 3 litres of water a day should keep you
    hydrated and healthy. \n</string>

    <string name="health_5">Socialise
    \nHaving a healthy diet and exercising aren\'t the only contributors in having a healthy lifestyle, socialise with your peers and have some fun once in a while to keep yourself
    (mind and body) healthy and free of stress\n</string>

        unprecedented time. But whatever situation you are in and wherever you are in the World,
        you have the power to look after your mental health and well-being.</string>

    <string name="mental_1">Amidst the whirlwind of academics and social engagements, remember to prioritize self-care. This includes nourishing your body with proper nutrition, getting adequate sleep, and engaging in physical activity.

        emotions and allowing yourself to feel them is an essential part of coping and healing.</string>
    <string name="mental_3">Try to continue doing the activities that you find meaningful and enjoyable, such as cooking for yourself or your loved ones, playing with your pet, walking in the park, reading a book, or watching a film or TV series.
        Having a regular routine with activities that make you feel happy will help you maintain good mental health.</string>
    <string name="mental_4">You\'re not alone in this journey. Having a support network can make a world of difference. Whether it\'s friends, family, teachers, or counselors, having someone to confide in can provide comfort and guidance during tough
        times. Don’t hesitate to seek help when you need it.</string>
    <string name="mental_5">Help free yourself of constantly swirling thoughts by reconnecting yourself with where you are at this moment in time. Simply take three slow deep breaths, feel your feet grounded on the floor</string>
