    <string name="health_1">A healthy diet
        \nA healthy diet involves eating a variety of foods in the correct proportions and consuming a calorie intake that allows for the maintenance of healthy body weight. Although this varies for everyone,
        as a general guide, this should include:
    \n\n\ta. Five portions of fruit and vegetables per day
    \n\tb. Lean proteins, especially fish, eggs, and white meat, are essential for cellular repair and provide a range of vitamins and minerals
    \n\tc. Dairy foods and their alternatives, which are a good source of protein and provide calcium.
    \n\td. Starchy foods, particularly wholegrain varieties which contain more fiber and nutrients
    \n\te. Limited amounts of unsaturated fats.
    </string>

    <string name="health_2">Physical activity
    \nThe World Health Organisation recommends that all adults undertake regular physical activity, including at least thirty minutes of moderate aerobic activity daily, supplemented by at least two weight-bearing activity sessions per week.
    \n</string>

    <string name="health_3">Sleep
    \nTry to get 7-8 hours every night and try to keep a regular sleep-wake cycle – go to bed and get up at the same time every day. A good nights sleep may make you more productive and efficient on the next day.\n </string>

    <string name="health_4">Drink Plenty of Water
    \nOur body is 75% water and it is necessary to maintain the amount of liquid we consume, especially water as it is the most vital liquid humans require. 8 glasses a day also equal to 3 litres of water a day should keep you
    hydrated and healthy. \n</string>

    <string name="health_5">Socialise
    \nHaving a healthy diet and exercising aren\'t the only contributors in having a healthy lifestyle, socialise with your peers and have some fun once in a while to keep yourself
    (mind and body) healthy and free of stress\n</string>

    <string name="clean_main">Many people equate hygiene with "cleanliness", but hygiene is a broad term. It includes such personal habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash clothes. It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including bathroom facilities.\n
    So, when did it all start?</string>

    <string name="clean_wash">The history of hygiene spans civilizations, evolving from early practices like ancient bathing rituals to the modern understanding of germ theory, prompting advancements in sanitation, clean water access, and public health measures.</string>

    <string name="clean_germs">The exploration of pivotal scientific moments in cleanliness history involves significant milestones, such as the discovery of bacteria by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century, revolutionizing our understanding of hygiene and prompting advancements in public health measures.</string>
